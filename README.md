# Scoopy-Delights

This project is a responsive and interactive website designed for an ice cream brand called “Scooped Moments”, offering users a delightful digital experience. The site features smooth navigation across sections like Home, About, Services, and Contact, along with a continuously playing background video that enhances the brand vibe.

The website also includes:

A modern dark mode toggle for user comfort.

A quote (“Sweetest Moments, Scooped to Perfection”) placed elegantly near the logo to reinforce branding.

A contact form with validation and a success message popup.

A carousel-style flavour showcase with hover animations.

A mobile-responsive layout to ensure accessibility on all devices.

Built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, this project reflects attention to user interface, brand identity, and responsive design, making it ideal for showcasing web development skills in a portfolio.
